# java-multithread-2_in_Critical-Section

Consider a scenario where students go to library, students study and students leave the  library.  
There  will  be  2  students  in  the  library  initially  and  other  3  will  be entering  the  library.  
The  condition  is  that  at  any  point  of  time  there  should  be  at least  2  students  studying  in  the  library.(eg  if  there  are  only  2  students  left  in  the library  and  if  1  student  is  studying  then  the  other  student  cannot   leave.  
The  last student can only leave once the student who was studying is done studying). You should  print  the  states  of  the  each  student  whenever  they  are  entering  the  library, studying  or  leaving  the  library  and  also  the  total  number  of  students  left  in  the library.
